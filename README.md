## Why I Built This

I just wanted to update my CV â€” but every site I tried made me do all the work, then asked for money to download it. A bit frustrating.

So I built this: a tool thatâ€™s actually free, easy to use, and produces a CV that looks good right away â€” no extra editing needed.

Friends were also asking for templates or help with their resumes, so I figured this could help more people.
